My name is Baptiste Mille-Mathias, and this is my digital home, I don't how long it'll be.
I'll post some pages from time to time if I find something noteworthy.

I have some engagement toward open source or opendata projects since 2002, like GNOME or [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

I have some github contribution you can find [here](ttps://github.com/bmillemathias?).

You can view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmillemathias/)
